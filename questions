Panasonic Questions
-------------------

* Scanners - do we target network enabled devices or not?
	* If not, then we need pc/etc attached for network access.
	* If not not, then what capabilities exist to send documents over the network?
		* What kind of software can we deploy to the device?

* Cloud - "google cloud print" model.
	* Organization has an account and then registers devices with this 'account'
	* Devices then send documents to HS in the cloud
	* The "cloud HS" is just a stock image, which can be deployed as an appliance on-site if there are 'firewall' concerns.
	* "cloud HS" has simple UI - allowing the "account" to sign in and see document's uploaded - that is the 'crack'
		* services can wire up specific productions to route docs to external systems.
		* these would run off 'edge/access' nodes in the cloud for each customer
